# PIAIC Project 1: Hello Gemini  

This is my first project under the PIAIC program, titled **Hello Gemini**. The project involves integrating Google's API key to interact with a Language Learning Model (LLM) and running a "Hello World" example. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project implementation, including execution on both Google Colab and a local machine.

---

## Project Features  
1. **Google API Integration**  
   - The project uses an API key from Google to establish a secure connection and interact with LLM services.  
   
2. **LLM Hello World**  
   - A basic "Hello World" implementation showcasing how LLM can respond using natural language processing.  

3. **Execution Environments**  
   - Google Colab for easy, online execution.  
   - Step-by-step guide for local execution for those who prefer running the project on their machine.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **API Integration**: Google APIs  
- **Environment**: Google Colab, Local Setup

## How to Run the Project  

### 1. Running on Google Colab  
Follow these steps to run the project on Google Colab:  
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](#).  
2. Ensure you have access to your Google API key.  
3. Paste the API key in the designated section of the code.  
4. Run the notebook cells step by step to see the output of the LLM's "Hello World."  

### 2. Running Locally  
To execute the project on your local machine:  
1. Clone this repository to your system:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-Iqbal-01/PIAIC-Projects.git  
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Add your Google API key to the environment or directly in the script.  
4. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash  
   python hello_gemini.py  
   ```

## Project Outcomes  
- Successfully demonstrated API integration with Google's services.  
- Generated a "Hello World" response using LLM, laying the foundation for future projects in the PIAIC program.  

---

## Notes  
- Ensure that the Google API key is kept secure and not shared publicly.  
- For any issues or questions, feel free to raise an issue in the repository or contact me.
