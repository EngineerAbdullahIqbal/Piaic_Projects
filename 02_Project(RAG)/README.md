# PIAIC Project 2: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  

This is my second project under the PIAIC program, focusing on **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. In this project, I will explore the core concepts of RAG and implement it step by step using example code. The project includes working with **document embeddings** and extends to performing embeddings on **images**, showcasing the versatility of RAG.

---

## Project Highlights  
1. **Comprehensive RAG Exploration**  
   - Understanding and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques.  

2. **Step-by-Step Examples**  
   - Example code for both documents and images to illustrate the process.  

3. **Embeddings on Different Data Types**  
   - Generating embeddings for textual documents.  
   - Extending the embeddings process to images.  

---

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Transformers, LangChain, OpenAI API, or other relevant libraries.  
- **Data Types**: Text Documents, Images

## How to Run the Project  

### 1. Document Embeddings  
- Preprocess and embed documents to create vector representations.  
- Use embeddings for efficient document retrieval and response generation.  

### 2. Image Embeddings  
- Extend the RAG workflow to images.  
- Generate embeddings for image data and integrate them into the retrieval-augmented pipeline.

## Implementation Guide  

### Running on Google Colab  
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](#).  
2. Follow the steps to install required libraries and load the dataset.  
3. Run the cells for document embeddings.  
4. Continue to the image embedding section for a complete RAG workflow.  

### Running Locally  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-Iqbal-01/PIAIC-Projects.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Follow the example scripts for both document and image embeddings.

## Project Goals  
- To master the implementation of RAG techniques.  
- To showcase the flexibility of embeddings for different data types (documents and images).  
- To lay the groundwork for advanced RAG applications.
